# sasbase
To prepare for the SAS base certificate I took an online class on Coursera. At the end of this class there were two capstone projects to showcase what I learned in the class.
I used SAS Studio in SAS On Demand for Academics to complete these projects.
The first project I worked with TSA claims data, and the second I worked with world tourism data.
I imported and cleaned these data sets, and then used them to run reports to answer questions, and exported the reports that answered the questions to a PDF.

I am also using this repository to store my code for pratice questions that I am using to study for the coding part of the exam.
