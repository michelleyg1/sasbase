# sasbase
As part of the SAS Base Certificate online class that I took, there were two capstone projects at the end to showcase what I learned in the class, as well as to prepare for the SAS Base Certification.
I used SAS Studio in SAS On Demand for Academics to complete these projects.
The first project I worked with TSA claims data, and the second I worked with world tourism data.
